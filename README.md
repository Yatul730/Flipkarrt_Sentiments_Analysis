The Flipkart review sentiment analysis project is an application of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to analyze the sentiments expressed in customer reviews on the Flipkart e-commerce platform. The goal of the project is to automatically classify reviews into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments based on the text content, providing valuable insights to businesses and customers about the products and services being offered.
The user working on the project would have to possess knowledge in NLP, data preprocessing, feature extraction, machine learning, and possibly deep learning. They would need to make decisions about the choice of algorithms, hyperparameter tuning, and handling class imbalances in the dataset . The success of the project depends on the quality of the data, the effectiveness of the chosen model, and continuous monitoring and improvement of the model's performance as more data becomes available. Additionally, the user may need to consider domain-specific challenges like handling informal language, sarcasm, or misspellings in customer reviews
